Conceptual Simple Ecommerce Site
==================
Conceptual is a Ecommerce site that was developed as a project for school. **This application is not reccommended for production.** There are security holes that need to be patched but were outside of the scope of the project.

Incomplete features and Known Issues
=================
* Password handling is crap
* Use of the outdated cart plugin j-cart. ( It was a requirment of the class :/ )
* Does not complete checkout (only logs in database)
* No payment option
* Many of the paths are hard coded (/dzelic/conceptual) since the server it was posted on required this
